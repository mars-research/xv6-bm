This is a small demo that takes parts of the xv6 kernel to demonstrate a simple
boot into "Hello world" demo on real hardware.  The kernel can be booted with
Grub (or any other boot loader that supports multiboot specification) and in
Qemu. 


We made several patches to make sure that xv6 boots on our machines. xv6 has
most of the bare metal support in place (I guess, it worked in the past but is
currently broken, hence we fixed it). 

Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a hight level the kernel is compiled into a single file kernelmemfs, it then
relies on te Grub to get loaded into memory.  Grub passes control to the entry
point of the entry.S that does minimal platform initialization and passes
control to main() in main.c.  main() initializes the console and the uart
interface and prints "Hello world!". After that it speens forever doing
nothing. 

Run on bare metal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: we tested on d820 machines in Emulab (they support serial line). CRG on a
laptop didn't work (we would appreciate help!)

1) Build the kernel

   make

2) Copy the kernel into the /boot folder

   sudo cp kernelmemfs /boot/

3) Add the following entry to the grub menu list. On a Linux machine this can
be done by adding this to the /etc/grub.d/40_custom. You might adjust the
root='hd0,2' to reflect where your Linux root is on disk, e.g., maybe it's on
root='hd0,1'

set timeout=30
menuentry "xv6" {
    insmod ext2
    set root='hd0,2'
    set kernel='/boot/kernelmemfs'
    echo "Loading ${kernel}..."
    multiboot ${kernel} ${kernel}
    boot
}

4) Update grub

  sudo sudo update-grub2

5) Reboot and choose the xv6 entry. Make sure that you can see the grub menu
list by editing /etc/default/grub making sure that GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET is
set to "false". 

  GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false

Run on Qemu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) You can run this "Hello world" demo in Qemu on your local machine

    make qemu

Original xv6 text
----------------------------------------------------------------------

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)

    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.828, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries. See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/tools.html.
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
